description: Six Gaussians (red) and their sum (blue). The Parzen window density estimate
  f(x) is obtained by dividing this sum by 6, the number of Gaussians. The variance
  of the Gaussians was set to 0.5. Note that where the points are denser the density
  estimate will have higher values. (none - wikipedia / public domain).
